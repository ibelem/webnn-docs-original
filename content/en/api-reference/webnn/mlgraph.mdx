# MLGraph

The `MLGraph` interface represents a compiled computational graph. Once constructed, a compiled graph is immutable and cannot be subsequently modified.

## Web IDL

```webidl showLineNumbers filename="web-idl"
[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface MLGraph {
  undefined destroy();
};
```

## Constructor

The `MLGraph` interface does not have a constructor. Instances are created through other APIs.

## Properties

This interface does not contain any properties.

## Methods

### destroy()

Releases all resources associated with the graph. Once called, the graph is marked as destroyed and cannot be used for further operations.


#### Syntax

```js showLineNumbers filename="example-1.js"
graph.destroy()
```

#### Return Value

- `undefined`

## Notes

- The graph is immutable after construction to ensure computational integrity
- All input and output operands must be properly described through their respective descriptors
- The implementation details are managed by the User Agent and are not directly accessible
- After destruction, no further workloads can be enqueued using this graph
- Implementations can free any additional resource allocations associated with this graph once all previously submitted workloads using it are complete

## Best Practices

- Always call `destroy()` when the graph is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks
- Ensure all operations on the graph are complete before calling `destroy()`
- Do not attempt to use the graph after calling `destroy()`

## Specifications

| WebNN API | Status |
|--------------|---------|
| [`MLGraph` Interface](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webnn/#mlgraph) | Candidate Recommendation Draft |

## Security Requirements

The `MLGraph` interface:

1. Requires a secure context (`SecureContext`)
2. Is exposed only to `Window` and `DedicatedWorker` contexts
3. Cannot be modified after construction to prevent tampering with computational graphs
4. Resource cleanup is performed asynchronously to ensure proper memory management

## Browser Compatibility

> <InfoIcon /> The `Graph` interface is under active development and browser support may vary.
