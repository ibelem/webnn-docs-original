Verified WebNN is compatible with following devices:

- Intel Core Ultra Desktop Processors
  - Meteor Lake (MTL)

- Intel Core Ultra Desktop Processors (Series 2)
  - Lunar Lake (LNL)
  - Arrow Lake (ARL)

## How can I monitor hardware resources available to WebNN in the browser?

You can monitor system resources using several browser and system tools:

- For GPU information:

  - Access about://gpu to view detailed GPU diagnostics and error logs
  - Check about://histograms/webnn for WebNN-specific performance metrics

- For general system resources:

  - Browser resources: Open Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge Task Manager (Menu → More Tools → Task Manager) to monitor memory usage and CPU consumption
  - System resources: Use Windows Task Manager to monitor CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization
