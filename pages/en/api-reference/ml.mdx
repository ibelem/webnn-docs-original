# ML

The ML Interface provides methods for creating and managing machine learning contexts in web applications.

## Syntax

```idl showLineNumbers filename="web-idl"
Promise<MLContext> createContext(optional MLContextOptions options = {})
Promise<MLContext> createContext(GPUDevice gpuDevice)
```

## Description

The `ML` interface enables creation of machine learning contexts with specific device and power preferences. It provides two methods for creating contexts - one accepting configuration options and another accepting a specific GPU device.

### Device Type Options

An enumeration defining supported device types for ML operations:
- `"cpu"`: CPU-based processing
- `"gpu"`: GPU-based processing
- `"npu"`: Neural Processing Unit-based processing

#### `"cpu"`
- Provides maximum compatibility across devices
- Variable performance based on hardware capabilities
- Default option if not specified

#### `"gpu"`
- Offers highest performance potential
- May fall back to other devices for certain operations
- Requires compatible graphics hardware

#### `"npu"`
- Optimized for power efficiency
- Suitable for sustained workloads
- May fall back to other devices for unsupported operations

### Power Preference Options

An enumeration specifying power consumption preferences:
- `"default"`: System-determined behavior
- `"high-performance"`: Prioritizes speed over power efficiency
- `"low-power"`: Prioritizes power efficiency over performance

#### `"default"`
- Lets the user agent determine optimal behavior
- Balanced approach to performance and power consumption

#### `"high-performance"`
- Maximizes execution speed
- May increase power consumption
- Suitable for compute-intensive tasks

#### `"low-power"`
- Minimizes power consumption
- May reduce performance
- Ideal for battery-powered devices

### ML Context Options
A dictionary of configuration options for ML contexts:

```idl showLineNumbers filename="web-idl"
dictionary MLContextOptions {
  MLDeviceType deviceType = "cpu";
  MLPowerPreference powerPreference = "default";
}
```

## Specifications

| Web Neural Network API Specification |
|-------------------------|
| [`ML` interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/#api-ml) |

## Security Requirements
- Requires a secure context
- Available in Window and DedicatedWorker contexts

## Examples

### Creating a Context with Default Options

```js showLineNumbers filename="example-1.js"
try {
  const context = await navigator.ml.createContext();
  // Context ready for use
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create ML context:', error);
}
```

### Creating a Context with Specific Options

```js showLineNumbers filename="example-2.js"
const options = {
  deviceType: "gpu",
  powerPreference: "high-performance"
};

try {
  const context = await navigator.ml.createContext(options);
  // High-performance GPU context ready
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create GPU context:', error);
}
```

### Using with a Specific GPU Device

```js showLineNumbers filename="example-3.js"
// Assuming we have a GPUDevice instance
const gpuDevice = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()
  .then(adapter => adapter.requestDevice());

try {
  const context = await navigator.ml.createContext(gpuDevice);
  // Context created with specific GPU device
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create context with GPU device:', error);
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

> ⚠️ The ML interface is under active development and browser support may vary.

| Browser | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Chrome  | In Development |
| Firefox | In Development |
| Safari  | In Development |
| Edge    | In Development |

## Development Status

The ML interface and MLContextOptions are actively being developed. Current considerations include:

- Implementation of fallback device mechanisms
- Support for multiple devices in preferred order
- Device exclusion capabilities
- Enhanced error handling
- Quantized operator support
