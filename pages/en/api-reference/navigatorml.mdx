# navigator.ml

The `navigator.ml` property provides access to the WebNN API, allowing web applications to interact with machine learning capabilities in the browser.

## Syntax

```js showLineNumbers filename="navigator.ml.js"
const ml = navigator.ml
```

### Value

An [`ML`](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/#api-navigator-ml) object that provides access to WebNN functionality.

## Description

The `navigator.ml` property returns a read-only reference to an `ML` object, which serves as the entry point for browser-based machine learning operations. This interface is:

- Available in both window and dedicated worker contexts
- Accessible through the `Navigator` interface in window contexts
- Accessible through the `WorkerNavigator` interface in dedicated worker contexts
- Protected by a secure context requirement (HTTPS or localhost)

## Specifications

| Web Neural Network API Specification |
|-------------------------|
| [The `navigator.ml` interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/#api-navigator-ml) |

## Browser Compatibility

The `navigator.ml` interface is experimental and support may vary across browsers.

## Example

```js showLineNumbers filename="example.js"
if ('ml' in navigator) {
  // ML API is supported
  const mlInstance = navigator.ml;
  // Use ML functionality here
} else {
  console.log('ML API is not supported in this browser');
}
```

## Security Requirements

Access to `navigator.ml` requires a secure context (HTTPS or localhost). Attempting to access this API in a non-secure context will result in an error.
