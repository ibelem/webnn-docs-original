# MLGraph

The `MLGraph` interface represents a compiled computational graph. Once constructed, a compiled graph is immutable and cannot be modified.

## Web IDL

```webidl showLineNumbers filename="web-idl"
[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface MLGraph {};
```

## Description

The `MLGraph` interface provides a representation of a compiled computational graph used in machine learning operations. Each instance maintains internal state through several slots that define its context, inputs, outputs, and implementation details.

### Internal Slots

The `MLGraph` interface maintains the following internal slots:

- `context`: An `MLContext` instance associated with this graph
- `inputDescriptors`: A record mapping input names (`USVString`) to their corresponding `MLOperandDescriptor`
- `outputDescriptors`: A record mapping output names (`USVString`) to their corresponding `MLOperandDescriptor`
- `implementation`: The underlying implementation provided by the User Agent

### Notes

- The graph is immutable after construction to ensure computational integrity
- All input and output operands must be properly described through their respective descriptors
- The implementation details are managed by the User Agent and are not directly accessible

## Specifications

| WebNN API | Status |
|--------------|---------|
| [`MLGraph` Interface](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webnn/#mlgraph) | Candidate Recommendation Draft |

## Security Requirements

The `MLGraph` interface:

1. Requires a secure context (`SecureContext`)
2. Is exposed only to `Window` and `DedicatedWorker` contexts
3. Cannot be modified after construction to prevent tampering with computational graphs

## Browser Compatibility

> <InfoIcon /> The `Graph` interface is under active development and browser support may vary.
