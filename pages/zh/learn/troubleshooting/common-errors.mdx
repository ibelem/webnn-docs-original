# Common Errors

## Why can't I observe performance benefits from WebNN GPU on Intel GPUs?

DirectML metacommands execution is disabled by default on Intel GPUs between driver versions `31.0.101.5518` and `32.0.101.6083`. To enable metacommands and evaluate performance on affected GPU drivers, add the following flag:

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="gpu-flag"
--disable_dml_meta_commands_for_gpu=0
```

Note: This flag only affects GPU inference and has no impact on NPU operations.
